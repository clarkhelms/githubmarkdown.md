To begin with two space bar strokes, two blank spaces make a line feed  
To make a phrase italic in markdown surround words with an underscore _this, for example!_

***this too*** can be used to make bold underline with three asterics!

In markdown there are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:  
just preface the phrase with a hash mark and a space,    
# This is header one  
## This is header two  
### This is header three  
#### This is header four  
##### This is header five  
###### This is header six

We preface images with an exclamation point  
For indenting block quotes we put a greater than caret in front of the paragraph  
>"To be or not to be"  
  
We can put one of these carets at the beginning of several lines including  
carets on blank lines to ensure the integrity of the quote  
>Once upon a time  
>  
>His motherd told him a story  
>  
>He was a baby tukoo  

For lists there are lists with bullet points and lists with numbers.  
To make an unordered list we preface each item with an asterisk  
* milk
* eggs
* cheese  

For the need of a nested list or outline we remember to indent each asterick  
two spaces more than the preceeding item  
* Plants    
  * that make one itch    
    * Poison oak  
    * poison ivy    
  
With listing paragraphs, essentially bullet points and paragraphs mixed. Or, a sequence    
of instructions with embedded detailed suggestions/information.  
Flax is grown on prairies to produce **linseed oil**, which dries solid  
and is used on wood because it is a pale yellow drying oil that polymerizes  
as a solid.    
**To use it on your project**  
1. Sand wood surface of things inhibiting the oil's penetration  
2. Mix with odorless mild thinner to enhance penetration
3. Apply with folded cloth  
   * wear eye protection  
   * wear gloves  
4. Bob Ross once quipped:  
     > We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents  
5. One more light swipe with a clean cloth to remove excess......
